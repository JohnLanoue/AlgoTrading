Welcome to the money printing machine: (Not yet profitable nor in production ready state).  
  There are three/four primary files: 
    Stock Market Predictor:(Depreciated Sept 2025): 
    
      THE WEB SCRAPING FUNCTIONS ARE OBSOLETE: READ ONLY. 
      
      This is a project where we read the sentiments, good/bad(buy/sell,) from articles for the opportunity to put positions in.  Combines knowledge of web-scraping, neural networks, and 
      
    Stock Market Predictor Multi-Method
    
    LSTM Vectorizer:
    
      This is where we test the LSTM model and look at its performance instead of accuracy. 
      
    LSTM Alpaca production: 
    
      Makes trades based on LSTM Results



    Additional Plans: 
      This project remains in the genesis page, and currentl,y no jobs are running in paper - production (Playing with Monopoly money as a way of testing). 
      Fixes: 
        Re-Preciate NLP file
      I plan to: 
        Make trades based on LSTM
        Create SMA Backtester (Algotrading Page 97)
        
      Tech Debt to pay off: 
        Scale Vectorized backtests 
        Run Sentiment Analysis
